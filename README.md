Description:
We are developing a mobile application for devices running a recent version of android os to act as a planner specialized for college students.

Vision Satement:
Less time planning is more time producing.

Motivation:
The purpose of developing this project is beceause as a college student it is difficult to find a place to track everything that you have going on with the functionality that makes it easy to have a hub for all your information.

Risks:
(to project completion):
-Java programming language is new to some team members
-Working with calenders is new to some team members
-Difficulty with schedule conflicts among team members.

Mitigating Strategy:
-We will create a long term plan including learning requirements for each team member based on where they are, while some people are catching up on the language that need to, the others will be learning new concepts.

User Stories:
